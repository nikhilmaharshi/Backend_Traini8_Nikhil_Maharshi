## Overview

The **Training Center Registry** is a Spring Boot application designed to manage training centers, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete training center records. This project uses PostgreSQL as the database and provides a RESTful API for easy interaction with the application. Swagger is integrated for API documentation.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Version 21
- **Spring Boot**: Version 3.x
- **MySQL**: Database
- **Swagger**: API documentation
- **Maven**: Build and dependency management

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK) 21** installed on your machine.
- **Maven** installed for building and running the project.
- **MySQL** installed and running on your local machine.
- An IDE such as **IntelliJ IDEA** or **Eclipse**.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the project:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nikhilmaharshi/Backend_Traini8_Nikhil_Maharshi.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd Backend_Traini8_Nikhil_Maharshi
   ```

3. **Build the Project**:

   Run the following command to build the project using Maven:

   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

## Configuration

1. **Database Configuration**:

   Open `src/main/resources/application.yml` or `src/main/resources/application.properties` (depending on your setup) and update the database connection details:

   ```yaml
   spring:
     datasource:
       url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database_name
       username: your_database_username
       password: your_database_password
     jpa:
       hibernate:
         ddl-auto: update
       show-sql: true
   ```

   Replace `your_database_name`, `your_database_username`, and `your_database_password` with your MySQL database details.

## Database Setup

1. **Create a Database**:

   Open your MySQL client and create a new database:

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE your_database_name;
   ```

   Make sure to replace `your_database_name` with the same name used in the configuration.

## Running the Application

To run the application, use the following command:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

The application should start on `http://localhost:8080`.


## API Documentation

Swagger provides an interactive API documentation for your convenience. To view details, including validation information for the API requests:

1. Open your web browser and navigate to:

   ```
   http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html

   ```

2. In the Swagger UI, you will see a list of all available endpoints. 

3. Scroll down to the **Schemas** section at the bottom of the page. Here, you can expand the following schemas to get detailed information about each:

   - **AddressRequestDTO**
   - **TrainingCenterRequestDTO**
   - **AddressResponseDTO**
   - **TrainingCenterResponseDTO**

4. By expanding each schema, you can view the fields along with their validation rules, data types, and example values, which will guide you on how to structure your API requests properly.

This documentation allows you to understand the requirements for each API request and response.


## Sample Data

To test the API, you can use the following sample data for your requests. Insert the sample training center data provided in the Add sample data section before testing.
